title: MEP Role Description
---

Members of the European Parliament are directly elected to represent the citizens
of the 28 EU Member States in the European Parliament. As in national parliaments,
these representatives work together in political groupings at an EU level. With
support from their respective factions, MEPs debate and discuss proposals drafted
by the European Commission, reports delivered by other EU institutions and general
developments in EU life.

However, as they are composed of MEPs coming from many different national parties,
political factions in the EP are not homogenous. Such diversity may generate some
difficulty in forming a common faction position. During debates, MEPs are often
expected to align themselves to the common position of their faction, but this
is not mandatory.

During MEU 2015, participants assigned the role of MEP shall work together with
their colleagues in order to reach a common position within their respective
factions and then try to create consensus in the EP and with the Council. In order
to facilitate cooperation between the two co-legislators, 3 MEPs shall be elected
to attend trilogue meetings, which will also involve the Permanent Representative
of Greece to the Council (note: Greece will be holding the presidency of the
Council during the first semester of 2014) and the Commissioner responsible for
each Proposal.

Political groupings (factions) are the same as in the real EP. Obviously in MEU
we will not have as many MEPs as in reality, due to the fact that this would
involve more than 800 participants in total. However, the analogy of the
repartition of MEPs per Country will be respected. We will also have Faction
Leaders and Faction Secretaries. These positions play a very important part
in MEU's EP and during the entire conference itself, as they provide both
leadership and official representation when it comes to press conferences for
example, and during negotiations with the Ministers and the Commission.

## Additional Roles

People who apply for MEP positions will be given the opportunity to apply for an
additional role. Should you be interested in one of these roles, please state in
the application form.

Pre-conference Faction Secretary - This is an optional additional role for the
Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Those applicants applying to be MEPs
may also express their interest in becoming a Faction Secretary by ticking the
relevant field on the application form. Faction Secretaries will act as coordinators
for their respective factions in the pre-conference period. They will be in charge
of organising internetbased faction meetings. They will also oversee the
preparation of the common Faction Position Papers based on the Individual
Position Papers. Once in Strasbourg, they will coordinate the very first faction
meeting, where the Faction Secretary will be elected. Every Faction Secretary may
stand in Faction Leader elections. Should they get elected, a new Secretary may
then be elected. It is important to note that this is not compulsory, yet it is
highly recommended that bigger Factions have a Faction Secretary who will help
Faction Leaders in their work. If they remain in their position, the Secretary
will remain responsible for administrative tasks within the faction. Please note
that this role is only additional â€“ every Faction Secretary remains a Member of
the European Parliament, too.

Once in Strasbourg, you may be elected to one of the following positions:

#### Faction Leader

Faction Leaders shall be elected by their respective factions on the very first
day of the simulation in the EP and every MEP may stand for nomination.
Alongside Faction Secretaries, Faction Leaders shall organise and coordinate
the work of their faction. They shall chair their faction meetings and organise
the drafting of amendments to the legislative proposals. At the beginning of
the debate on each proposal in the EP, they shall hold a short speech in which
they shall present their faction's position on each proposal.

#### Faction Secretary

Faction Secretaries are recommended for the bigger factions and also elected
during the first faction meeting by all members of their respective factions.
Any member may stand in the election. The work of the Secretary is to assist
Faction Leaders in their work. They will also replace their respective Faction
Leaders, should the latter be absent. It is recommended that Faction Secretaries
assist their leaders in the writing of speeches, due to time constraints.
