At MEU Strasbourg 2015 both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers
will be presided over by a team of two chairs. The titles themselves – President
and Vice President of the Parliament/Council imply a great level of importance
and responsibility that chairs hold at MEU. It is the chairs who are responsible
for the smooth running of the debates in both chambers, a role that is not the
most visible one when things are going well, however an absolutely vital one at
all times.

The crucial responsibilities of the chairs are:

- To keep order in the Parliament and in the Council,
- To ensure that the Rules of Procedure are followed and respected,
- Ensure that every single Member of the Parliament and Minister of the Council
  have the same right to speak and to reply,
- Guarantee that the debates are run in an atmosphere of mutual respect and no
  one’s rights are being infringed upon,
- To uphold the level of formality of the conference.

At the MEU Strasbourg simulation, the President and Vice President of both the
European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are expected to remain neutral,
thus not stating their political opinion or pushing forward any political agenda.
The chairs’ responsibility is to facilitate the debates, to guide and help the
MEPs and Ministers to come to an agreement. They should have an in depth knowledge
of the Rules of Procedure.

As the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers differ significantly in
their size, the chairing styles in both houses will be adjusted to the specific
circumstances. In the European Parliament, as a body with more than 100
participants, the President and the Vice President of the Parliament will
need to be very time-conscious and will not hesitate to strictly but respectfully
enforce the Rules of Procedure. Since the Council just comprises 28 Ministers
chairs might be more lenient when it comes to speaking times and time-keeping.
Nonetheless, the President and Vice President will need to ensure that the Rules
of Procedure are upheld. It is their task to ensure that the conditions for
debate are equal and fair.

The President and Vice President should inspire their peers, moderate the debates
successfully, facilitate compromise, and help make MEU 2015 a great success and
enriching experience for everyone.
