The Social Fund has been specifically designed to help financially disadvantaged
participants to attend the Conference.

Although we are not in a position to
reimburse the participation fee (150 EUR), we might be able to help you finance
your travel costs. Note that the entrance to the European Parliament’s premises
is completely free of charge.

Please bear in mind that our budget is limited and we cannot guarantee that
everybody who applies will get financial aid. Financial aid will be awarded
in consideration of the participant’s travel costs, parental income and his/her
additional financial resources for the conference.

For more information on the Social Fund please consult the relevant section
of the Frequently Asked Questions: Financial Assistance.

Please be aware that incomplete application forms will not be considered.
If you get selected for the conference you will be informed shortly on the
outcome of your financial assistance application.
