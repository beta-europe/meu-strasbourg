      <h1><a id="MINISTERS_0"></a>MINISTERS</h1>
      <p>As a Minister of the Council, you are a member of one of the most influential actors in the European Union. As one of just 28 ministers, you will experience the intense atmosphere of the Council first hand, and will be asked to take the floor again and again to defend your case. The stakes are high in the Council and there are no back-benches to hide.</p>
      <p>As Minister of the Council, the primary role you have is representing the political interests of your national government in the given policy area. From the beginning, therefore, it becomes your role to find powerful allies in the ministers of other member states, but also to form alliances with MEPs that agree with you in the parliament. If you do not, the risk is that a compromise you have fought for in the Council will be voted down in the Parliament.</p>
      <p>This is particularly important because the council of MEU Strasbourg, like in the real council, uses qualified majority voting, which makes it very difficult to reach agreements among the ministers. Add to this that journalists will constantly seek to expose the difference of opinion within the Council, and lobbyists will use every break trying to sway you to vote one way or the other on a particular amendment. As a minister of the Council, you are definitely in for a challenge.</p>
      <p>To facilitate the important cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, Trialogue meetings are organised during each coffee break to make sure that the ministers know what is going on in the parliament and vice versa. During the first day of discussions, two ministers are elected by their peers to represent the Council at these discussions, so if you are up for an extra challenge, you have the chance to nominate yourself on the first day of discussions.</p>
      <p>An additional opportunity for ministers is to participate in the daily press conference, during which all the journalists present will be given the chance to ask you out on the developments of the day. The press conference are attended by everyone and are incredibly demanding, especially for ministers who have to convey a diplomatic account of the days negotiations in the council to an audience who haven’t been given access to their proceedings.</p>
      <p>As a minister, you should be familiar not only with the policies of your Member State but also with the policies of other member states, as forming alliances and creating consensus play a crucial role in the Council. Due to the small number of the members of the Council - in comparison with the Parliament- a single vote can define the final result, so make sure you have enough support on your side as well as support from both MEPs, lobbyists and journalists, without whom you will be undermined in your role.</p>
      <p>Being a minister at MEU Strasbourg is a unique opportunity! Apply today!</p>
