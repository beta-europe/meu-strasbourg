      <h1><a id="Apply_as_a_Lobbyist_0"></a>Lobbyist</h1>
      <p>As a lobbyist at MEUS 2016, you will become a professional advocate tasked with championing the cause of an outside interest.</p>
      <p>An essential ingredient of democracy and legitimacy, lobbyists work to shape legislation to favour the will of those whom they are contracted to represent. You might become the voice of a big corporate company, or even a human rights NGO - your challenge is to champion your designated cause as if it were your own!</p>
      <p>Your first job, before you arrive in Strasbourg, will be to write a very short position paper for each organization to outline your thoughts on how you will represent each group. Will they be for or against the passing of this legislation? What is their central argument? How would they like the wording of the legislation to be amended? This will also allow you to preview the intentions of your peers, and indicate who you might want to work with or against.</p>
      <p>Arriving at the conference will be your first taste of what it’s like to be a real life lobbyist. In order to convince many politicians to support your cause in parliament, you must get networking straight away. Contacts are the key to success. Lobbyists are renowned for working hardest at the coffee breaks and during the social programme. Schmooze your peers, and win them over to your interests so that they vote how you would like them too.</p>
      <p>Lobbyists in the past have had a reputation for working in the shadows, making private deals to manipulate the process. One piece of leverage that you have is your expertise; as one of the only participants with computer/internet access, you will play a very useful role for MEPs and Ministers of the Council by providing specific information about particular sectors, so that the politicians can make an informed choice on how to vote on complex, nuanced issues. Thus, your challenge is to strike a balance between providing reliable facts, while also presenting your case in a way that puts a positive spin on your organisation’s interests!</p>
      <p>You will also have the chance to attend debates in the European Parliament in order to stay informed on developments. Use this opportunity to pass notes of information to your “inside connections”. Furthermore, you will have a few opportunities to address the Parliament and the Council of Ministers publicly in the chambers. The more political actors you convince, the more likely it is that your amendments will be incorporated into the legislation. As there will be competing views in amongst the team, you may wish to form strategic coalitions with your peers to spread your message to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>Another way to gain support is through working with the media team. Journalists are always looking for a story or interview, and publicity stunts can be used to raise the profile of your organisation or cause. This can be a double-edged sword, however; you must be careful that they don’t report negatively! This part of the process can greatly develop your interview and presentation skills.</p>
      <p>Because of their “shadowy” and secretive reputation (especially during the past), lobbyists can be viewed by some as untrustworthy. Your challenge is to win politicians round through a combination of charm and reason. The extent to which you engage in deceit for the sake of your goals is up to you - but watch out for your credibility!</p>
      <p>The essential ingredient to success in your work is enthusiasm. This is a high-energy role and your networking job is continuous around the clock. This puts you in a unique position to not only practice the art of lobbying from an impressively realistic simulation, but also to use the process to make close friendships across the world that last beyond the final vote.</p>
