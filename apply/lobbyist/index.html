      <h1><a id="Apply_as_a_Lobbyist_0"></a>Lobbyist</h1>
      <p>As a lobbyist at Model European Union Strasbourg 2017, you will become a professional advocate tasked with influencing legislation on a particular issue.</p>
      <p>An essential ingredient of democracy and legitimacy, lobbyists seek to influence government and its institutions by informing the public policy agenda. You can be the voice of a corporate company (in-house), a consultancy representing the interests of their clients (in-consultancy), or even a not-for-profit organisation—your challenge is to champion your designated cause as if it were your own! </p>
      <p>Your first job before arriving in Strasbourg will be to write a short position paper for the organisation you will be representing outlining your thoughts on how you will represent its interests. Will they be for or against the passing of a certain piece of legislation? What is their main argument? How do they want the wording of the legislation to be amended? This will also allow you to preview the intentions of your peers, and indicate whom you might want to work with or against. </p>
      <p>Arriving at the conference will be your very first taste of what it is like to be a real life lobbyist! In order to convince as many politicians as possible to support your cause in the parliament, networking is the key word and it should happen straight away. Contacts are the key to success. Lobbyists are renowned for working hardest at coffee breaks and during the social programme. Schmooze your peers, and win them over to your interests so that they vote how you want them to. </p>
      <p>In the past and even nowadays, lobbyists have had a reputation for working in the shadows, making private deals to influence the process. But a successful lobbyist should have one piece of leverage, and that is their expertise. As one of the only participants with computer and internet access, you will play a useful role for the Members of the Parliament and Ministers of the Council by providing specific and well-documented information about particular sectors. In this manner, politicians can make an informed choice on how to vote on complex, nuanced issues. Your challenge is to strike a balance between providing reliable facts whilst also presenting your cause in a way that puts a positive spin on the cause you are championing.</p>
      <p>At Model European Union, you have the chance to attend debates in the European Parliament in order to stay informed on developments. Use this opportunity to pass notes of information to your inside connections. Since you also have a few opportunities to address the Parliament and the Council of Ministers publicly in the chambers, ensure that you send across your message in a clear and concise way. The more political actors you convince, the likelier it is that your amendments will be incorporated into the legislation. As there will be competing views within the team, you may wish to form strategic coalitions with your peers and thus spread your message to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>Another way to gain support is through working with the media team. Journalists are always looking for a story or interview, and publicity stunts can be used to raise the profile of your organisation or cause. This can be a double-edged sword, however: be careful that they do not report negatively! This part of the process can greatly develop your interview and presentation skills.</p>
      <p>Because of their shadowy and secretive reputation, especially in the past, lobbyists can be perceived by some as untrustworthy. Your challenge is to win politicians over through a combination of reason and charm. The extents to which you engage in deceit for the sake of your goals are entirely up to you, but watch out for your credibility. Think long-term! </p>
      <p>The essential ingredient to success in your work is enthusiasm! This is a high-energy role and your networking job is continuous around the clock. This is also a chance to practice the art of political persuasion from an impressively realistic simulation and—above all—to make close friendships across the world that last beyond the final vote.</p>
