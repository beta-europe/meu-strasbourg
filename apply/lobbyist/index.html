      <h1><a id="Apply_as_a_Lobbyist_0"></a>Lobbyist</h1>
      <p>As a lobbyist at Model European Union Strasbourg 2018, you will become a professional advocate tasked with influencing others in order to shape legislation to best suit your interest group. You can be the voice of a company (in-house), a consultancy representing the interests of their clients (in-consultancy), or even a not-for-profit organisation—your challenge is to champion your designated cause as if it were your own!</p>
      <p>Lobbyists play an essential part in democracy, as they offer expertise and industry insights to decision-makers, thus conferring more legitimacy to the policy-making process. They are also actors in an uneven playing field, whose ultimate goal is the advancement of their own agenda. Your challenge is to win politicians over through a combination of reason and charm. The extent to which you engage in deceit for the sake of your goals are entirely up to you, but watch out for your credibility. </p>
      <p>Your first job before arriving in Strasbourg will be to write a short position paper for the organisation you will be representing, outlining your thoughts on how you will represent its interests. Your interests. Will you be for or against passing a certain piece of legislation? What is your main focus? What are your main arguments? What needs to be added to or removed from the legislation? Who are your most likely friends? Who do you need on your side? </p>
      <p>Keep those answers in mind as you will step into the shoes of a real life lobbyist as soon as you arrive in Strasbourg. In order to convince as many politicians as possible to support your cause, networking is key and it should be your first priority. Contacts are essential to success. Lobbyists are renowned for working hardest at coffee breaks and during the social programme.</p>
      <p>In the past and even nowadays, lobbyists have had a reputation for working in the shadows, making private deals to influence the process. But a successful Brussels lobbyist relies on a clean public reputation. Because of their shadowy and secretive reputation, lobbyists can be perceived by some as untrustworthy, and that is an obstacle you will have to overcome. As some of the few participants with computer and internet access, you can play a useful role for the Members of the Parliament and Ministers of the Council by providing specific and well-researched information about particular sectors, to strengthen their arguments and positions. Make sure that the decision-makers are aware of how you can help them make informed choices on how to vote on complex, nuanced issues. Your challenge is to strike a balance between providing reliable facts whilst also presenting your cause in a way that puts a positive spin on the cause you are championing. Since you also have a few opportunities to formally address the Parliament and the Council of Ministers in the chambers, ensure that you send across your message in a clear and concise way.</p>
      <p>You will have the most flexible role in the simulation. You can choose to attend debates in the European Parliament, observe the power dynamics, and use your expertise (and internet connection) to pass notes of information to your inside connections. Or you can focus more on networking during coffee breaks and socials. You can choose who you work with - be it decision-makers or your peers. </p>
      <p>You may find that forming an alliance with a fellow lobbyist enables you to spread your message to a wider audience. Or you may work better on your own. Journalists can also be your friends. They are always looking for a story or an interview, and publicity stunts can be used to raise the profile of your organisation or cause. However, this can be a double-edged sword: be aware that they have they own agenda, and be careful that they do not report negatively.</p>
      <p>The essential ingredient to success in your work is enthusiasm! This is a high-energy role and your networking job is round the clock. This is also a chance to practice the art of political persuasion from an impressively realistic simulation and—above all—to make close friendships across the world that last beyond the final vote. </p>
