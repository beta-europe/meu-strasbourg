      <h1><a id="Role_of_journalist_video_journalist_and_photojournalist_0"></a>Role of journalist, video journalist and photojournalist</h1>
      <p>Being part of the journalistic team at MEUS is one of the most interesting roles due to the various different tasks that the team undertakes. Your job will be to follow the events that unfold in the conference, the social events and any other fascinating event that might arise, then using this information, create a piece of writing, a news report or photo to present to everyone at MEUS. It is a brilliant role because you will find that, even at social events, you will still be channelling your inner journalist and will find yourself continually trying to gather information you can use, while having fun. This is a great opportunity for those wanting to venture into a journalistic field in the future, especially since everyone at the conference takes their role very seriously and being part of MEUS gives you insight into what is really is like to be a journalist. The journalist team will be informing participants on a daily basis about the decisions, moves and agreements achieved in the committees. You will be present when there are discussions, lobbying and persuading, decisions – your role will be one of the most demanding and important ones at MEUS.</p>
      <h2><a id="Journalist_2"></a>Journalist</h2>
      <p>Your role will be to collect information over the course of a day with the end goal being an interesting, informative article for the daily newspaper. This includes doing interviews with delegates, chairs, members of the Council and lobbyists and being present at the social events. It is crucial that the journalists keep to their role even during the coffee breaks as they will be able to gather the best, perhaps more elusive information from other participants; it is also a great way to recap on what has been happening in the Council and Parliament should you have missed anything. This is especially important because journalists are not given access to the Council and you will need to make the most of the breaks to try and get a picture of what is happening in the Council in order to report information to your readers. You will be expected to keep the participants informed of any advancement in the debates, be it breakthroughs or fall-backs. Articles should start to be written relatively early so they can be submitted before lunch; therefore it is important that you aim to be present at the events that take place so that you have a constant supply of article ideas. Ideally you will come to the Parliament with an idea in mind, but the Journalist Coordinator will have a meeting every morning to go over article ideas to help those who feel a bit stuck or are unsure of what to write. Articles do not always need to be political and can be light-hearted informative pieces on Strasbourg or the social events, the choice is yours. It must, however, be well-written and the information you present must be high quality. Professionalism is key. An incredibly fun aspect of being a journalist is gathering questions and information for the press conference at the end of each day at MEUS. This is the moment where you can put all the information you’ve gathered to use; you will be given the opportunity to question members of the Parliament and Council, and they, in turn, to retort. You will need to bring your own equipment to write articles and research information.</p>
      <h3>Print Journalists must submit the following:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Their CV</li>

      </ul>
      <h2><a id="Photojournalist_8"></a>Photo journalist</h2>
      <p>During the conference you will be expected to be present in the Parliament and social events to document events that take place. Your role is integral to the formation of the newspaper; the photos you take will be used to help illustrate articles and will be used online. (You can work alongside journalists to take photos for a specific article.) Think of yourself as paparazzi, you will need to be there to take photos of the reactions of the members of parliament or catch them in situations they shouldn’t be in, having said that, make sure you do not interfere where you shouldn’t and always be professional and don’t over step boundaries. You will need to have the relevant equipment for taking photos and editing yourselves.</p>
      <h2><a id="Video_journalist_10"></a>Video journalist</h2>
      <p>Much like the photojournalist your role will be to document the events that unfold throughout the day in order to make a news-cast that will be played after the press conference. Organisation and creativity are key skills in this role; you will need to ensure you have conducted the interviews you need, have recorded your news anchor efficiently, and collect footage of debates or tripartite meetings. The day goes by quickly and you need to ensure you have time to fully edit and finish your work so that it is high quality and something you will be proud to show to the conference. You are free, to a certain extent, in the way you wish to present your information; for example, you can use voice-overs, face-to-face interviews or even a montage of the social events with music. Professionalism is incredibly important, as is high quality footage. You will need to have to relevant equipment and software to edit the raw material yourselves</p>
