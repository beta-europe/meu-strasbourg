      <h1>JOURNALISTS </h1>
      <p>Being part of the journalistic team at MEUS is one of the most interesting roles due to the various different tasks that the team undertakes. 
          Your job will be to follow the events that unfold in the conference, the social events and any other fascinating event that might arise, then using this information, create a piece of writing, a news report or photo to present to everyone at MEUS. 
          It is a brilliant role because you will find that, even at social events, you will still be channelling your inner journalist and will find yourself continually trying to gather information you can use, while having fun. 
          This is a great opportunity for those wanting to venture into a journalistic field in the future, especially since everyone at the conference takes their role very seriously and being part of MEUS gives you insight into what is really is like to be a journalist. The journalist team will be informing participants on a daily basis about the decisions, moves and agreements achieved in the committees. 
          You will be present when there are discussions, lobbying and persuading, decisions – your role will be one of the most demanding and important ones at MEUS.</p>
      <h2>PRINT JOURNALISTS</h2>
      <p>Firstly, we can assure you that your role is the most dynamic one. 
          Your job will be to collect information over the course of a day with the end goal being an interesting, informative piece of daily newspaper and broadcast. 
           This includes doing interviews with delegates, chairs, members of the Council and lobbyists and being present at the social events, always with your eyes wide open. 
           It is crucial that the journalists keep to their role even during the coffee breaks as they will be able to gather the best, perhaps more elusive information from other participants. 
           Since journalists are not given access to the Council, you will need to make the most of the breaks to try and get a picture of what is happening in the Council to report information to the public. 
           The coffee break is a working spot for you!  You will be expected to keep the participants informed of any advancement in the debates, be it breakthroughs or fallbacks. 
           Your articles should be sharp, accurate and professional. Articles do not always need to be political and can be light-hearted informative pieces on Strasbourg or the social events, the choice is yours. It must, however, be well-written and the information you present must be high quality. 
           Moreover, written articles will not be the only choice on how you want to present your news. Pop-up conferences, video reports, and daily broadcast are just the beginning of possibilities for your journalist work. This year you will have the opportunity not only to write articles but to become a reporter, TV host and Press Secretary. 
           An incredibly fun aspect of being a journalist is gathering questions and information for the press conference at the end of each day at MEUS. This is the moment where you can put all the information you’ve gathered and use them to challenge members of the Parliament and Council on their knowledge and competence. Every morning there will be a brainstorming meeting with your Journalist Coordinator on preparations, ideas, and plans. 
           Even if you feel a bit stuck, don’t worry cause together with your excellent team, every day will be the challenging and sufficient day of real journalist’s life.</p>

      <h2>PHOTO JOURNALISTS</h2>
      <p>A picture is worth a thousand words. There is no great article without a great photo and there is no great journalist team without the person behind the camera. This is where you step in. Your role is integral to the formation of the newspaper; the photos you take will be used to help illustrate articles and will be used online. You can work alongside journalists to take photos for a specific article and with the PR team. During the conference, you will be expected to be present in the Parliament and social events to document events that take place. Think of yourself as paparazzi, you will need to be there to take photos of the reactions of the members of parliament or catch them in situations they shouldn’t be in. However, make sure you do not interfere where you shouldn’t and always be professional and don’t over step boundaries. Professionalism is the key. You will need to have the relevant equipment for taking photos and editing yourselves.</p>
      <h2>VIDEO JOURNALISTS</h2>
      <p>Much like the photojournalist, we need you to have a full and sufficient journalist team. Your role will be to document the events that unfold throughout the day in order to make a news-cast that will be played after the press conference. Moreover, pop-up conferences, daily broadcast and video reports will be your time to shine. You will also work closely with print journalists and reporters on creating professional daily broadcast. Organisation and creativity are key skills in this role. You will need to ensure you have conducted the interviews you need, have recorded your news anchor efficiently, and collect footage of debates or tripartite meetings. The day goes by quickly and you need to ensure you have time to fully edit and finish your work so that it is high quality and something you will be proud to show to the conference. You are free, to a certain extent, in the way you wish to present your information; for example, you can use voice-overs, face-to-face interviews or even a montage of the social events with music. Professionalism is incredibly important, as is high-quality footage. You will need to have to relevant equipment and software to edit the raw material yourselves.</p>
