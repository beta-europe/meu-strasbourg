      <h1>Member of the Parliament</h1>
      
      <p>At Model European Union Strasbourg 2017, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are at the very centre of the simulation. Like in the real European Parliament you will be a member of one of the 8 political groups (factions) that comprise the parliament, and will thus be charged with promoting conservative, liberal, social-democratic or other values depending on the group you are assigned.</p>
      <p>To add an extra level of complexity, you will also be assigned a nationality within your given faction, so that national differences, like in the real European Parliament, can also create debate and division within the factions you become a member of. The particular brand of social democracy you promote as a member of the S&D faction, for instance, will depend on whether you represent the British, Portuguese, Slovenian or Finnish Social-Democrats.</p>  
      <p>During MEUS 2017, therefore, participants assigned the role of MEP shall work together with their colleagues firstly to reach a common position within their respective factions and then try to create consensus in the EP and with the Council. In order to facilitate cooperation between the two co-legislators, 3 MEPs shall be elected to attend trilogue meetings, which will also involve the two representatives of the Council of the European Union and the Commissioners responsible for the two proposals.</p>
      <p>As an MEP you will also need to work together very closely with both the lobbyists and the journalists to make sure that your point gets across. This is particularly a challenge if you are a member of a bigger faction; so make sure to form alliances with lobbyists who support your cause, or journalists who are willing to put an interview with you in the daily newspaper. They will be in the parliament throughout the week to follow the negotiations, to make sure to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>One of the unique opportunities you have as an MEP is to be elected either Leader or Secretary of your faction.
      <p>As a faction leader you give the opening statements, negotiate with the other factions and make sure that your faction has a consistent lines on both topics, which your colleagues can agree to. It’s an extra responsibility, but also a unique opportunity to act as a political leader in a hectic environment.</p>
      <p>As a faction secretary your role is quite similar to that of the leader. During the daily faction meetings you will take the minutes, make sure that everyone is heard, and during the debates support both the leader and the other MEPs in their work.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, the role of MEP gives you the opportunity to participate in daily press conferences, where the journalists will ask you out about the political agreements and intrigue that has unfolded during the day.</p>
      
      <h3>MEPs must submit the following:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Their CV</li>
        <li>Their Motivation Letter (250 words (250 words ±10%);</li>
        <li>Their answer to ONE essay question (500 words ±10%)</li>
      </ul>
