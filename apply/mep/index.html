      <h1>Member of the Parliament</h1>
      
      <p>At Model European Union Strasbourg 2018, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are at the very centre of the simulation. Like in the real European Parliament, you will be a member of one of the 8 political groups (factions) that comprise the Parliament, and will thus be charged with promoting conservative, liberal, social-democratic or other values, depending on the group assigned.</p>
      <p>To add an extra level of complexity, you will also be assigned a nationality within your given faction, so that national differences, like in the real European Parliament, can also provoke debate and division within the factions you become a member of. The particular brand of social democracy you promote as a member of the S&D faction, for instance, will depend on whether you represent the British, Portuguese, Slovenian or Finnish Social-Democrats.</p>  
      <p>Therefore, during MEUS 2018, participants assigned the role of MEP shall work together with their colleagues, firstly to reach a common position within their respective factions, then to try and create consensus in the EP, as well as within the Council. In order to facilitate cooperation between the two co-legislators, 3 MEPs shall be elected to attend Trialogue meetings, which will also involve two representatives of the Council of the European Union and the Commissioners responsible for the two proposals.</p>
      <p>As an MEP, you will also need to work together with both the lobbyists and the journalists, in order to make sure that your point gets across. This is particularly challenging if you are a member of a bigger faction; so make sure to form alliances with lobbyists who support your cause, or journalists who are willing to interview you for the daily newspaper. They will be in the Parliament throughout the week and follow the negotiations, so make sure you make the most of it!
</p>
      <p>One of the unique opportunities you have as an MEP is being elected to become either Leader or Secretary of your faction. As a faction leader, you give the opening statements, negotiate with other factions and make sure that your faction remains consistent on both topics. It is an extra responsibility, but also a unique opportunity to act as a political leader in a rather hectic environment. </p>
      <p>As a faction secretary, your role is quite similar to that of the leader. During the daily faction meetings, you will take minutes and make sure that everyone is heard. During the debates, you should support both the leader and the other MEPs in their work. </p>
      <p>Last but not least, the role of MEP gives you the opportunity to participate in daily press conferences, where the journalists will ask you questions about different political agreements and intrigue that has unfolded during the day.</p>
      
      <h3>YOU CAN BECOME AN MEP IF:
        <li>You are between 18-26 years old</li>
        <li>You are a student or graduate</li>
        <li>You have a good level of English</li>
        <li>You have interest in EU decision-making procedures and/or the topics at hand</li>

      <h3>MEPs must submit the following:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Their CV</li>
        <li>Their Motivation Letter (250 words (250 words ±10%);</li>
