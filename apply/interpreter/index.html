      <h1><a id="Apply_as_an_Interpreter_0"></a>Interpreters</h1>
      <p>As an interpreter you will play a pivotal role in MEUS: you will interpret
        speeches, debates, meetings with lobbyists and press conferences, both from
        English into your mother tongue and from your mother tongue into English
        (providing relay interpreting for the other booths). Your work will make
        the conference more realistic, dynamic and inclusive. You will work mainly
        in the simultaneous mode, but you will also be able to try your hand at
        consecutive interpreting and chuchotage (whispered interpreting), getting
        the opportunity to hone in a variety of interpreting skills in a near
        real-life working environment providing the best conditions for an excellent
        interpreting performance. If you are a student or recent graduate in
        Translation and Interpreting Studies, this conference represents a unique
        opportunity to put your abilities to the test, gain first-hand interpreting
        experience in state-of-the-art booths at the European Parliament and meet
        other talented budding interpreters from all over Europe. With the highest
        number of languages covered by interpretation of any such simulation, MEUS
        is a truly multilingual event. Don’t miss this chance to get a head start
        in your career as a conference interpreter!
