        Model European Union Strasbourg (MEUS) is a unique simulation of EU
        decision-making and politics that takes place annually in Strasbourg,
        a city that carries a lot of symbolism in relation to peace and democracy in Europe.

        Each year, the conference brings together <em>200 highly motivated students
        and young professional</em>, giving them the exclusive opportunity to have
        first-hand experience of the functioning of European institutions right on
        the premises of the European Parliament. The project is thus completely
        original in the world of simulations and is already extremely popular
        among young Europeans from diverse backgrounds, from Law, International
        Relations, Political Science and European Affairs to History, Media
        Studies, and Interpreting.

        During the course of the simulation, participants <em>debate two
        controversial, real-life legislative proposals</em> drafted by the
        European Commission and simulate EU law-making by <em>acting as Members
        of the European Parliament</em> or <em>Members of the Council of the
        European Union</em>. The simulation, however, features even more roles
        for participants in order to enhance its realism. Specifically,
        participants can also act as: (1) <em>Lobbyists</em>, that work towards
        influencing the decision-making process in favour of the interests they
        represent; (2) <em>Journalists</em>, who, through press conferences and
        interviews, cover and analyse debates in a daily newspaper and video
        footage; and (3) <em>Interpreters</em>, offering professional interpreting
        services in the national languages of the EU using the special equipment
        provided by the European Parliament.

        It goes without saying that MEUS amounts to <em>a unique learning
        process</em> that focuses on the workings and dynamics of EU
        institutions when producing EU law. MEUS is therefore an educational
        project that succeeds in giving participants the opportunity to develop
        their skills in EU law, debating and negotiations at EU level and to
        understand the complexities of the EU in practice.
      </p>

        Consequently, MEU is distinguished by its educational value, academic
        excellence and professionalism that render it one of the most successful
        and prestigious simulations in the world. Moreover, by creating a truly
        European atmosphere in a purely European environment, MEUS affirms each
        year its reputation as a contributor to the goal of <em>European
        integration</em> and to the <em>emergence of European identity</em>.
