    title: Member of the European Parliament
    text: |
      As an MEP at MEU Strasbourg you will be at the very heart of the simulation.
      Your task will be to establish a faction line on each policy area, pursue
      it rigorously and defend yourself against attacks from your political
      opponents, tricky questions from the journalists, and influence of the
      lobbyists. Your arguments will be interpreted into many languages,
      and you’ll have to find common ground – also with the political extremes.

  - image: role-minister.svg
    title: Minister
    text: |
      As a minister at MEU Strasbourg, you are there to defend the political
      interests of your national government. You will debate with your 27
      fellow ministers in an intense and close­knit council, where only what
      everyone can agree to escapes to the press (ideally!). As a minister you
      will have to get a qualified majority to support you in the council, a
      majority in the often divided parliament – and to have a few lobbyists and
      journalists on your side doesn’t hurt either.

  - image: role-interpreter.svg
    title: Interpreter
    text: |
      Interpreters play a pivotal role in MEUS: they interpret speeches, debates,
      meetings withlobbyists and press conferences, both from English into their
      mother tongue and from their mother tongue into English, thus making the
      conference more realistic, dynamic and inclusive. Interpreters mainly work
      in the simultaneous mode in state­of­the­art booths at the European Parliament,
      but they can also try their hand at consecutive interpreting and chuchotage
      (whispered interpreting), getting the opportunity to hone in a variety of
      skills in a near real­life working environment providing the best conditions
      for an excellent interpreting performance.

  - image: role-lobbyist.svg
    title: Lobbyist
    text: |
      The role of the lobbyists is to stir up the debate, advocating strongly
      for outside interests. These could represent the needs of anything from
      large corporate entities, to human rights NGOs. Inside the European
      Parliament, the lobbyists have the chance to present influential research
      and convincing speeches to rally support. A large proportion of their
      success, however, lies in their ability to network effectively during the
      coffee breaks, over lunch and whilst enjoying the social program. Build
      your network of influence and shape the legislative outcome of the process
      so that it favours your client!

  - image: role-journalist.svg
    title: Journalist
    text: |
      As a journalist at MEUS you will take on a very demanding and important
      role due to the various different tasks that the team undertakes. Your job
      will be to follow the events that unfold in the conference very carefully.
      You’ll inform participants on a daily basis about the decisions, moves and
      agreements achieved in the committees via a daily newspaper, photos and
      newscasts. This is a great opportunity for those wanting to venture into
      a journalistic field in the future, as being part of MEUS gives you insight
      into what is really is like to be a journalist.

      As you participate in this conference, whether you are a minister, an MEP, a journalist,
      lobbyist or interpreter, I trust that this week will increase your knowledge about the 
      European institutions and how demanding it can be to find common solutions to Europes issues.

    position: President of the European Commission
  - text: |
      It's important that young people engage themselves in European politics and that 
      they look how EU politics work in practice. I am very pleased that they are going to 
      the European Parliament in Strasbourg, where they can sit in plenary themselves, 
      where the heart of European Democracy is.

      <h2>European Politics Simulation</h2>

      <p>        
        <strong>Join us from 18th to 25th March 2017 for the next edition of Model European Union Strasbourg</strong>,
        the original and authoritative simulation of European politics. We were founded in
        the spring of 2007 by a group of university students and have since grown to be the
        world’s largest and most authentic simulation of the EU’s decision-making process.
        Bringing together 200 young Europeans, our intense, weeklong conference is held
        <strong>inside the European Parliament in Strasbourg</strong> – and the two topics
        discussed this edition are the <strong>countering terrorism</strong> and <strong>third country 
        nationals access to the internal market</strong>. During the conference, you will have the chance to test yourself
        and interact with others in a professional but friendly environment, where you
        experience the internal functioning of the EU first hand. The official language
        of MEU Strasbourg is English, but there will be interpretation into all major
        European Languages!

        During the conference, roughly 200 participants have the chance to interact with each 
        other in a professional and friendly environment, where they can truly 
        comprehend the internal functioning of the EU. Each year they debate two 
        real-life legislative proposals drafted by the European Commission and 
        simulate the EU decision making process by taking on the roles of:

      <p>
        MEU is not only a unique educational project that gives its participants the
        opportunity to develop their skills in debating, communication and lawmaking 
        in a truly international setting. It is also a place where lifelong friendships are 
        formed and where the true spirit of European integration flows!
