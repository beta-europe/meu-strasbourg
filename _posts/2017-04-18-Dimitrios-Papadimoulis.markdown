Model European Union Strasbourg is a positive and interesting initiative of young people from all around Europe. Each year this project brings 180 young Europeans in Strasbourg where they meet to discuss and work to amend real proposals made by the policy - makers. MEUS contributes to better understanding of EU decision-making process and brings together young people with diverse academic and geographical backgrounds, thus fostering active citizenship in European Union.

I would like to express my support to the Model European Union Strasbourg 2017 and wish the Organizing Team and participants every possible success.
